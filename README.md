Material Me!
============

This is a extended version of the "Material Me" app from the [Android
Developer Fundamentals Course](https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/google-developer-training/android-developer-fundamentals-course-concepts/details). It's uses Shared Elements Transitions to start DetailActivity. The toolbar and actionbar are colored by the dominant color of the CardView's image. When the app starts, each CardView from the RecyclerView is animated (with a light delay) using slide animation.
